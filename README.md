# Master debug Raspberry Pi

Hello everyone, this project comes with the idea when, i have to use a laptop every day to go to a place
just to program a microcontroller using the Arduino IDE, but one thing that tires me is having to carry 
the case of my laptop with my Lenovo 14 "and accessories, this problem can be fixed by just using a more ergonomic laptop sleeve, or using a backpack **but** this project may have more important features when finished like: 
- More battery life compared to a netbook or laptop of mid-range
- Versatility
- Low space consumption
- Modular capabilies
- With the FPGA you can have a lot of peripherials 
- Cheap to make
- New keyboard design

## Principal list of components

- Raspberry Pi Zero
- Mi Powerbank 3
- TFT screen 4,3"
- EP4CE6E22C8N FPGA Development Board

## Objetive and caracteristics

With the Master debug Raspberry pi you can go
